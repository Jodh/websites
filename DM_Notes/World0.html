    <h3>Creation Myth</h3>
    <p>As far as historians know there existed a single world called Ur. 
    It existed on the plane of Mundus. All of us and other living beings were born from it. 
    It is not known who created Ur or the plane of Mundus or where it came from. 
    A few millennia after Ur existed, the thinking beings of Ur learnt to define and bind the world around them.

    A few of them learnt and gained power words. 
    Words great and terrible enough to fight over and soon Ur was broken into many pieces 
    and flung far and wide over the plane of Mundus. Realizing what their actions had brought forth. 
    They ceased the war and left on an expedition to find all the lost parts of Ur 
    and in doing so they explored and cataloged the whole plane of Mundus itself. 
    When eons later their self-given quest was done. They became stronger than before. 
    They weaved and stitched all the parts of Ur and many other worlds into a single world, 
    which we today simply call plane of Mundus because the world spans the whole plane and 
    they are one and the same now. Upon completing this great task the learned beings were enlightened 
    with the knowledge of a higher plane and creatures of even greater power, 
    creatures so powerful they cannot be named using Mundus Terminology. 
    We refer to them as just Gods, Mundus word for something beyond explaining. 
    Most of the learned beings were invited by these Gods and ascended to the Plane of Unknowing 
    where the Gods dwell. These Gods have never interfered with Mundus since.
    A few of the learned beings refused the invitation and created their own Planes of Inconsuetum 
    somewhere in between the plane of Mundus and Plane of Unknowing. 
    They took over aspects of nature and philosophies and decided to look after the denizens of plane 
    of Mundus. Each of these divines is given a Mundus name, causing them to be further bound to the 
    plane of mundus and perhaps some argue be reduced in power as compared to the Gods.

    <p>Plane of Mundus being stitched together across space and time has a few consequences. 
        If one travels far enough in a single direction the geography tends to change suddenly. 
        Suns tend to change color and size in the span of a 
        single step and full moon nights turn into a night of five crescent moons. 
        These scars or stitches are a spectacle to watch for common folk but an everyday occurrence 
        for seasoned travelers.

    <h3>Creation Myth Addendums</h3>
    <p>The process of breaking of the plane of Mundus is refered to as The Sundering by many folk and scholars
    of the subject. The sundering was not a instantaneous process but took place over centuries of cold
    open warfare between only specific groups of people. The words of power which gave these groups control 
    over the landmases of the plane of mundus were monopolised by, the aptly named, Scholars of Maya. These 
    individuals were mostly concerned with controling large portions of the plane of mundus and attaining 
    Maya or material power. They would study a portion of the plane and bind themselves to it and shape it
    into their desiers. As a consiquence the natural order and magic of the land would be under huge strain
    to accomodate for the morphing. When a scholar of Maya that has become a namer of a land suddenly losses
    control of that land, the area tries to revert back to its pre-naming state. This is a very violent
    process and causes a magical whiplash across the land, ripping it apart. This sundering on the plane
    of mundus manifests itself as physically breaking away and flying into space.
